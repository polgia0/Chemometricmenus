The \bold{Geometric Mean} (\emph{x_gmean}) can be used for right skewed 
distributions (e.g. lognormal distributions). There is no built-in 
function in the basic packages of R for the geometric mean,
 but a function has been written in the menus to allow the
 user to compute automatically this descriptor. The geometric mean 
 is rarely applied and the User must be careful not to input in this
 function negative numbers (x_gmean requires \emph{xi>0} for all \emph{i}).
 In addition the function must be used with caution, knowing that 
 overflows are easily generated by product series.
